\section{Conclusions}
	Working with the three devices is doable for two weeks, but it takes effort to stay focussed and to not forget anything. With more than a million records from multiple data devices, preprocessing takes a lot of time. The code is not advanced, but it is complex because of all the stages the data needs to go through. A lot of loops are used. The way I used the dataset resulted in a trainingset of 15 days and 15 days is not enough to draw trustworthy conclusions, but it is a begin. There are other ways to use the data and if a sampling frequecy of once per every hour is used, it will give 360 hours. The OpenBeacon is nice to have as an extra, but in my situation location can't explain the things I do, because I use the locations for multiple things and most of the time I'm in my bedroom. 
	There are more interesting subjects than me for the experiment. I live structural, don't have health complains, don't smoke, don't do drugs, drink no or little alcohol, drink no coffee and sport a lot. Not a typical student. When a subject is chosen with an unregular live schedule the correlations between the different features could be different, because relations could be more visible. Before the experiment I was thinking about doing something different in one week and doing something else in the other week. It would be interesting to see how I would react. For example drinking coffee before going to bed. However, data mining has a paradigm to don't use hypotheses. If there is a correlation, it will show up eventually.

	Despite the few days of data, I could agree with the correlations measered. Going later to bed and wake later up will result in more deep sleep, more light sleep and less REM sleep. Based on this I would advice myself to sleep less. With an average of 9 hours and 24 minutes in bed per night, I think that's fair. The interface of Beddit is easy in use and also informative. An advice I read on the website of Beddit was to sleep more structural, even more structural I already did. Now I'm trying to wake up and go to bed every day on the same moment. Beddit is still running at the time of writing this and I visit the website of Beddit still every day. The statistics motivates me to keep me to my schedule and to improve my life style. I changed my environment to make it darker and sometimes uses earplugs to ignore noise.

	In the further more devices could be added to the experiment. Like the Nike Fuel, easier to wear 24/7. Or something what keeps record on a convient way what I eat, because that's also an really important factor in life. 
	

	In 3-5 years more and more wearable sensors systems are going to be used by the mainstream. Nike already started the mainstream trend with the Nike Fuel stapperteller. They make it comperable and it would be cool to compare yourself with a sport athelete or just a friend. I see it in front of me, "Hé , you ate last week x calories, but sported just 5 hours, prepare yourself Summer is coming." You will challenge each other to sport. 

	Most of the systems will get an API and I predict an online social community will be get popular. It will collect all the data and will make it comparable and sharable with friends. 
	websites / communities will come up to combining the data and present it on a gemakkelijk manier. When that time will come it would be interessant to ask for the data and do data mining experiments again.

	preprocessing a lot of time, 
	need more devices, like calories counter or nike feul.
	More interesting subjects, I'm quite boring, I live to structural.
	Sleep in a structured way improve sleep, 
		but not enough data to really proof correlation between day and night
	Interessted future research, find to partners as subject and see how their lives influence each other.
	This is just a basic experiment and could be really extended by a next student.
	15 days is not enough, more like 15 months. 
	naieve about the data. 
	Still, it is a good setup and could be extended and replaced with maybe easier and better sensors. 
 The models didn't work out well.


	- products dataset
	- lot of data
	-  some insides of sleep
	I have bradycardia. 
	- more features for training set, but not enough rows. ratios.

	at first I had a idea to drink before going to bed coffee one week, and the next week no coffee. This will result in hopefully a good different sleep patterns. But the Data Mining has a paradigm to don't stel op a thesis and collect all the data and see the conclusions afterwards. The problem is, I don't drink coffee, much alcohol, drugs, energy drink or strange things that's could give interessant data because it will interupt/aanpassen my normal life. 
When humans query data we start with an idea, such as: "I think that we sell more DVDs to males than to females." And then we run a query to test the idea and the answer either confirms or disproves our hypothesis. A data mining algorithm doesn't have ideas. It has no intention of testing ideas for the simple reason that it doesn't have any.

	For another person who has regular shifts maybe better results would came up.


	The beddid is still running every night, and I watch the resuls every day. I improved my life style, not per se because of this project with combining data, but only to watch the statistiscs of my night and watch the advices it's given me. Yesterday I broke my record of deep sleep at the night. I sleep strictly regular, (yes more regular than during the tracking with the bioharness and the openbeacon combined.) and changed some things in my bedroom to make it darker. I also use more noise cancceling earplugs. So it's interessting just by seeing the data makes me want to improve my lifestyle. 

	Quantified jan is a selftracking freak an has a lot of systems, and he putted it all only. Only it are all sepered systems and not combinbed.

	There are some correlations, but not strong ones. Not much more days to be certain about the correlation.
