	This subsection has some theory, to get a view of the big picture. Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining\cite{wirth2000crisp} is invented out of necessity for better planning, documentation and communication for Data Mining projects. It's divided in multiple phases, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:crispdm}. The business understanding phase is to describe the urge and the goal of the project, see Section~\ref{seq:motivation}. The data understanding phase is to learn about the data, what is the source and how it is computed. In Section~\ref{sec:sensorsystems},~\ref{sec:datadescription} and ~\ref{sec:bvsb} the sensors systems are described, how they are used and what the data is. Normally the data is already collected, but this project needs another phase. The data collection phase is described in Section~\ref{sec:datacollection}. The next phase is the data preparation phase. In this project it exists out of two parts. The first part is about preprocessing to compute the dataset, as seen in Section~\ref{sec:preprocessing}. The dataset can be used by the Liacs Data Mining Group for further research. The second part is the feature extraction section, which describes the computing of the training set, seen in Section~\ref{sec:feature}. 
	A model is a generalised representation of the data. An algorithm tries to make relations between attributes. There are three reasons to make such an model:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Prediction. A bank give loans to clients and they will try to choose the best interest rate, such that the client will accept the interest rate, can pay the interest rate and the loan back over time and the bank will make a profit. Based on data from old clients a model can be made and the probability of a client getting problems with paying the intereset rate can be calculated. Based on this information the high of the loan and the interest rate can be determined.\cite{credit} Another example is predicting the age of a Twitter user\cite{tweetgenie}.		
		\item Insight. After analyzing the correlation between products bought together in a supermarket, management decided to place diapers and beer close together. More customers who bought the diapers were tempted to buy beer just by seeing it, which resulted in more impulsive sales\cite{beer}.
		\item Classification. Email spam\footnote{Unwanted email} filters are using classification to determine if an e-mail is spam or ham\footnote{Not spam}. Based on the previous received emails with their associated label spam or ham, a model can be based to predict the class of a new received email. 
	\end{enumerate}
	Models need to be trained, by a training set. The bigger the training set, the better the model, because of the chance is higher the set will represent all possible data. The better the model, the better the relations between the attributes are expressed. Next subsection analyzes the data by looking to the correlations / explains how to make a model. When the model is made it's time to analyze the results. / Is it possible to achieve the goal? The deployment is the implementation to achieve the goal. This could be a new piece of software for bank employees or a new price for a product. 

	\subsection{WeKa}
	- What is WeKa. java implementation for a lot of data mining algorithms.
	- M5p, Quinlan's M5
	- linear regression
	- neural network
	- results 

	avgHr vs hr100+
	out vs bedroom
	out vs hr120-140
	dining.room - kitchen

	inbed vs avgNoise: hoe later naar bed -> hoe minder geluid?, doordat je waarschijnlijk niet aanwezig bent in de kamer.
	outbed vs stageA: later naar bed, vaker away, later opstaan.
	outbed vs inbed: correlatie is 0.21. 

	light sleep neemt toe naarmate ik later naar bed ga, maar deep sleep ook. Val dus sneller in slaap. 
	Sleep efficiency neemt toe als ik latar naar bed ga. (r=0.5) Later opstaan zorgt juist voor het tegenovergestelde.
	later naar bed gaan dan gisteren resulteert ook in lagere sleep efficiency
	outbed vs inbed: r = 0.49
	Sta ik later naar bed, of later uit bed dan gisteren, gaat de efficiency omlaag 
	target

	\subsection{Correlations}
	In Table \ref{tab:cor}, 28 correlations are listed. Analyzing the results gives some trivial conclusions, but also interesting ones. \#3 says when I wake up later, the difference between the previous wake up is greater. The higher the correlations the more consistent the sleep rythm. \#6 says, the later I go to bed, the more I'm away from my bed. \#11 is also trivial. \#1 and \#4 are more interesting, because it means when I diverge from my normal sleep rythm, I will sleep less efficient. Going later to bed and waking up later will result\footnote{``Will result'' is not precisely true. Correlation doesn't mean causality, but in this paragraph the causalities are assumed.}  in less REM sleep and it will not be at the expense of deep sleep. As a matter of fact, the correlation is positive, it will result in a bit more deep and light sleep. Going later to bed will result in less time awake in bed, but sleeping longer in the morning will result in more awake time. \#18 is also an interesting correlation, but the resting heart rate is relative constant, so it doesn't need to mean anything. A high heart rate will result in a less efficient sleep, based on \#20 and \#27, but based on \#21 and \#24 it will result in more deep sleep. Most trivial correlation is \#28, because stageW is part of the formula to calculate the sleep efficiency.

	Data understanding, What are the systems measuring : Section 2.
	Normally data is already collected, in this project not. So an extra step.
	Data preparation is getting from the raw data to the training set, but in this project there are to steps to produce it.
	First from the raw to the dataset. This dataset can is provided and can be used by the liacs data mining group.
	from dataset to trainingset, in feature extractin section



	Derivate a dataset, use WeKa for modeling, find patterns.

	
	model, A way to describe the data. Generalization.
	prediction, classification, understanding the model.
	- linear regression
	- nearal network
	Now the modeling part.

	Next is the evaluation, which conclusions could be made.

	At least the deployment, implementation of the conclusions. To reach the goal and improvement.
